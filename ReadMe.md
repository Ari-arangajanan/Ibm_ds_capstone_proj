## IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone Project

This project focuses on predicting the successful landing of the SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage. SpaceX significantly reduces launch costs by reusing the first stage, offering launches at $62 million compared to competitors' $165 million. Accurately predicting landing outcomes helps estimate launch costs and supports competitive bidding. In this capstone, you will collect and preprocess data from APIs to build predictive models for Falcon 9 landings.
